    <p>We appreciate that many of our guests will be travelling a long way to be with us for our special day. In order to get the most of the weekend, there are plenty of interesting things nearby:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Colchester is a really nice market town with plenty of historical shops in quirky alleyways. It also has a zoo.</li>
        <li>Chelmsford is a little further, but has lots of great restaurants and has Essex CCC (I will update if there's a fixture on any of the surrounding days).</li>
        <li>Frinton-on-sea is a long open beach, about 30 mins drive away.</li>
        <li>Braintree Freeport is a collection of outlet discount shops about 15 mins away.</li>
        <li>Coggleshall and Kelvedon both have plenty of local (and historic) pubs!</li>
        <li>Dedham Vale AONB is great for country walks and wildlife.</li>
    </ul>
